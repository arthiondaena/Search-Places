We used to frequently visit there till 2022 and both the food & service were awesome. One of the few places in Hyderabad that used to have authentic North Indian food. Staff were courteous and friendly. Back to 2024, we visited the place last Friday and were appalled at the complete change from our previous experiences. Firstly, if you go in as a couple (group of 2), they will not let you seat at the tables adjacent to the floor railing (from where you have the outside views and arguably the best seats in the restaurant). They will lie that these seats are reserved when actually the entire place was empty at around 8 PM. I had to argue with them and finally they gave us a corner seat which had the smallest table ever in any restaurant that I have visited. Secondly the food was horrible. The chicken starters tasted uncooked and had raw chicken smell. The dried chilli chicken was worse. Naam and butter chicken were ok ish. They will have items in the Menu but apparently some of them are not available. Like we wanted Mutton Biriyani but the staff said no. The less I tell about service the better and this really irritated me. Whenever we wanted something, we would have to shout at full volume to call the staff to take our orders or to clean our plates or to bring the menu. Multiple times they will see us waiving at them and they would simply ignore it. It is apparent that they have changed their staff (my guess is the cook also) and these people have zero training or understanding about customer service at a restaurant. Will never visit again. Attaching pics only for our proof of attendance , otherwise people might think that this is a paid review.",

Understandable as that was post lunch and pre dinner time. None of the items that need a tandoor weren't available like Naan, Chicken Tandoori etc.\n\nThe food was amazing, enjoyed all the appetizers (Oriental Cigar Rolls, Apollo Fish and Tawa Prawns), main course (Chilli Garlic Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken) and desserts (only Sizzling Brownie was available) we've ordered.\n\nThis brings me to the only disappointment, being the only people there, the staff just couldn't care less, they were just out there somewhere in their own world chatting in a group the whole time we were there. Had to literally call them multiple time to take a single order. The food took too much time to arrive as well.\n\nBetter service could've made this a 5 star experience.",

First things first, the ambience here was really good with a great view of KBR park.\n\nGot here with a couple of friends at 4:30 pm, probably not the best time to visit as the whole place was empty like literally we were the only people there other than the staff. Understandable as that was post lunch and pre dinner time. None of the items that need a tandoor weren't available like Naan, Chicken Tandoori etc.\n\nThe food was amazing, enjoyed all the appetizers (Oriental Cigar Rolls, Apollo Fish and Tawa Prawns), main course (Chilli Garlic Fried Rice and Chilli Chicken) and desserts (only Sizzling Brownie was available) we've ordered.\n\nThis brings me to the only disappointment, being the only people there, the staff just couldn't care less, they were just out there somewhere in their own world chatting in a group the whole time we were there. Had to literally call them multiple time to take a single order. The food took too much time to arrive as well.\n\nBetter service could've made this a 5 star experience."
