The location, accessible easy car parking with valet (though you may not need it unless the parking lot gets full), the luxurious welcome arch and gateway which in particular makes you feel like you're transported to a different world are really good. On entering you will definitely like the variety of seating arrangements, whether be it the open area with shades, a cafe like area and then the more traditional restaurant setup on the first floor. The quality of ambience is top notch and this is really what you should come to experience when here. Come here prepared to spend more than an hour, eat at a leisurely pace, bring a book to read, etc.\n\nNow let's about the meal experience in itself. We had chicken wings, pita bread with hummus for appetizers followed by pesto cream pasta and tofu broccoli rice Chinese Bowl. The food is more or less 4 stars for their taste, presentation and portions. The food is meant to be enjoyed a bit bland as the taste is subtle. Portions were good for 2. The wait staff were friendly though they seemed a bit understaffed even to support a modest crowd.\n\nOur meal worked out to 1000INR per person, so you know you really paid for the ambience (which is why you should come here prepared for the experience and not the food by itself). 5 stars since I pretty much expected a very friendly ambience for a date with my loved one, and then got it here!",

The ambiance was warm and inviting, with just the right balance of elegance and comfort. The service was impeccable; the staff were attentive, knowledgeable, and genuinely friendly, which enhanced the overall experience.\n\nThe food was the true highlight. Every dish was thoughtfully prepared, bursting with flavor, and beautifully presented. From the starters to the dessert, each bite was a testament to the chef\u2019s skill and attention to detail. The menu offered a great variety, catering to different tastes and dietary preferences.\n\nOverall, this place is a gem, perfect for a casual outing or a special occasion.
