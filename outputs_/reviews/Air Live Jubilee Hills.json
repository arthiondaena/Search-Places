Horrible, that you have to stand for whole night if its just 1 or 2 of you go here.

If you express even the slightest disagreement or hesitation, their immediate response is to call in bouncers rather than resolve the issue calmly and respectfully. This behavior is both intimidating and unprofessional.\n\nAdditionally, they imposed a cover charge before allowing entry, which would have been understandable had the service and experience justified it\u2014but it clearly did not.

The cost is like any other pubs in that area 36 is a road of its kind. Crispy corn chicken 65 and tikka with pizza is good. Strictly avoid place if you are not adjusted to noise area.",
