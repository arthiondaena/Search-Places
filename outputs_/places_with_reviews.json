Two best things about the pub - live music: very vibrant and refreshing new brands every week. And the second things is the choice of drinks. They have a decent spread, with cocktails the best among them.\n\nOver priced place, and would need atleast 4 people to join for a table. Horrible, that you have to stand for whole night if its just 1 or 2 of you go here. Additional coupons or charges at the entrance, 1000 INR per person (mind you even you book online and with no guarantee of a seat inside).\n\nOtherwise its a good vibe and good place for a live music."

The staff displayed a complete lack of professionalism and courtesy, with no regard for customer service. I recently visited the place with a friend, and from the moment we arrived, the experience was frustrating.\n\nThere was no one available to greet or assist us. We had to find our own table, only to be told much later that the spot was reserved and we needed to move. After relocating to another table as suggested by the staff, we were once again asked to shift because, apparently, that table was also reserved. The lack of coordination among the staff was appalling.\n\nWhat made the situation even more unacceptable was the aggressive attitude of the management. If you express even the slightest disagreement or hesitation, their immediate response is to call in bouncers rather than resolve the issue calmly and respectfully. This behavior is both intimidating and unprofessional.\n\nAdditionally, they imposed a cover charge before allowing entry, which would have been understandable had the service and experience justified it\u2014but it clearly did not. Overall, it was a complete waste of time and money. I strongly advise others to avoid this place, as it lacks both customer care and basic decency."

It look awkward for me that they do over booking than their capacity.\n\nIf capacity is 200, its fair to have 210 guests but here they are allowing more than 300 or 400 guests and they charge everyone equally and good amount.\n\nPlease take bookings only upto your capacity and DO NOT overbook and give the guests the worst ever environment / atmosphere / ambience"

It wasn\u2019t just entertainment\u2014it added soul to the whole experience.\n\nThe service was smooth and the staff was attentive without being pushy.\n\nPrices are slightly on the higher side, but the live music, lively atmosphere, and overall experience make it worth it.\n\nIf you're in the mood for good music, chill vibes, and a place that feels alive, Airlive should be on your list."

The waiters didn't gave us the desired table even after asking multiple times. The bouncer didn't allowed us to stand in front for images/videos and always nudged us to go away. The performance lasted for max. 30 minutes while we were there for around 2-3 hours. Overall not a good experience, won't recommend and visit again."

Well I will prefer the jubilee hills branch more than the Madhapur one, all because of the ambience. It has rooftop whereas the Madhapur one is kind of enclosed.  But the vibe at both the places are incomparable. Moreover, the food here is nice and okay."

The bouncers have taken my valet parking token and they asked me to wait outside the gate. Surprisingly they have given my new Tata Curvv EV to a stranger and they went away with my car. After sometime they returned to the restaurant and they realised that it was not their car and handed over it to me. In this gap when we asked the person who took my valet parking token, he upfront denied by saying we are not responsible. I urge the senior management of Air live to please go through the CC footage of 8th June, Sunday night to understand more about our situation. This is really very bad experience and I will never ever visit this place again in future."

We were 4 and gave 4000 to enter. Since our bill was 6500, we got the 40% off on remaining 2500 bill.\nBut this a go to place if you are looking for a perfect music night to enjoy and cherish...!"

The cost is like any other pubs in that area 36 is a road of its kind. Crispy corn chicken 65 and tikka with pizza is good. Strictly avoid place if you are not adjusted to noise area."

We used to frequently visit there till 2022 and both the food & service were awesome. One of the few places in Hyderabad that used to have authentic North Indian food. Staff were courteous and friendly. Back to 2024, we visited the place last Friday and were appalled at the complete change from our previous experiences. Firstly, if you go in as a couple (group of 2), they will not let you seat at the tables adjacent to the floor railing (from where you have the outside views and arguably the best seats in the restaurant). They will lie that these seats are reserved when actually the entire place was empty at around 8 PM. I had to argue with them and finally they gave us a corner seat which had the smallest table ever in any restaurant that I have visited. Secondly the food was horrible. The chicken starters tasted uncooked and had raw chicken smell. The dried chilli chicken was worse. Naam and butter chicken were ok ish. They will have items in the Menu but apparently some of them are not available. Like we wanted Mutton Biriyani but the staff said no. The less I tell about service the better and this really irritated me. Whenever we wanted something, we would have to shout at full volume to call the staff to take our orders or to clean our plates or to bring the menu. Multiple times they will see us waiving at them and they would simply ignore it. It is apparent that they have changed their staff (my guess is the cook also) and these people have zero training or understanding about customer service at a restaurant. Will never visit again. Attaching pics only for our proof of attendance , otherwise people might think that this is a paid review."

No telgu songs. We really enjoyed the evening here.\n\nIts not a big place. But a small and cosy rooftop pub. Try to get a place in fornt of the stage. Its open and you can enjoy the natural beauty. They have a huge menu to choose from for both veg and nonveg. Food was ok. They dont have draught beer. Ultra and budweiser is priced at 355.\n\nAmbience and service was good. As there was no much crowd but decent crowd. They dont have any proper dance floor. Finding the place was a bit difficult but its not a issue. They have parking service."

Okay this is one of the rare live music places with no cover charge hence they have a lot of people wanting to come. The crowd is huge. On Saturday night, they remove chairs and you've to stand and eat all the time. You don't get a table despite booking a table on district. Yeah they continue taking bookings from all platforms despite being at 200% capacity utilisation. Around 11:30, the crowd is no less than Dadar station. There is just no space of dance. People are barely standing. But greed has no limit hence they keep getting more and more people in. Average food.

Definitely not like a supposedly high end luxury dining.\n\nService was very good, attentive and quick.\n\nFor food and drinks we tried different items, all of which tasted good, probably the highlight was the blue cheese chicken tikka.\n\nPrice is definitely on the higher end, definitely not budget friendly.\n\nOverall we had a satisfactory experience."

Additionally, there have been mixed reviews regarding service efficiency and food quality.  \ufffc\n\nIn summary, Tevar provides a luxurious dining experience that blends contemporary and classic Indian flavors. However, potential diners should be prepared for premium pricing and may want to manage their expectations regarding service and food consistency."

Ordered coconut prawns as starter, it was served within few minutes (not as hot as out of the frying pan). Taste wise I would rate one \u2b50\ufe0f. Slightly over priced, may be due to location and ambience. It was a week day, still they have very less available tables for the walk in customers. We went there for dinner, but had to leave for other place due to taste and sitting options offered to us. To visit with prior booking is recommended.\n\nNot at all a good experience.

Ambience is so well designed that you can capture all your moments in group pictures,  selfies and make it memorable. Talking about food, delicious Hummus with Pita Bread, mouth watering thin crust pizza, authentic Shorba with bread, creamy Pasta and refreshing mocktails. The staff was really quick and helpful. Overall a well spent family time with yummy food. The best part of Le Vantage, it is a pet friendly place."

However, my experience here has been mixed.\n\nWhile the ambiance is undoubtedly a highlight, I found the seating arrangements to be somewhat uncomfortable, with limited space between tables. This detracted from the overall comfort of the dining experience.\n\nUnfortunately, my disappointment extended to the menu offerings. Despite visiting the caf\u00e9 bar multiple times over the past few months, I failed to find dishes or drinks that truly appealed to my palate. While taste preferences vary, I found both the food and cocktails to be rather average, lacking the wow factor I had hoped for.\n\nAdditionally, the pricing at L\u00e9 Vantage Caf\u00e9 Bar leans towards the higher end, which may not be justified by the quality of the offerings. While I wouldn't discourage others from giving it a try, especially for the ambiance alone, I do believe that the establishment could benefit from refining its menu and focusing more on customer service.\n\nOverall, L\u00e9 Vantage Caf\u00e9 Bar falls short of expectations, with its standout feature being the ambiance. While it may not leave you with a feeling of regret, it also fails to deliver anything truly exceptional. For me, the food and drinks were passable but didn't leave a lasting impression."

The location, accessible easy car parking with valet (though you may not need it unless the parking lot gets full), the luxurious welcome arch and gateway which in particular makes you feel like you're transported to a different world are really good. On entering you will definitely like the variety of seating arrangements, whether be it the open area with shades, a cafe like area and then the more traditional restaurant setup on the first floor. The quality of ambience is top notch and this is really what you should come to experience when here. Come here prepared to spend more than an hour, eat at a leisurely pace, bring a book to read, etc.\n\nNow let's about the meal experience in itself. We had chicken wings, pita bread with hummus for appetizers followed by pesto cream pasta and tofu broccoli rice Chinese Bowl. The food is more or less 4 stars for their taste, presentation and portions. The food is meant to be enjoyed a bit bland as the taste is subtle. Portions were good for 2. The wait staff were friendly though they seemed a bit understaffed even to support a modest crowd.\n\nOur meal worked out to 1000INR per person, so you know you really paid for the ambience (which is why you should come here prepared for the experience and not the food by itself). 5 stars since I pretty much expected a very friendly ambience for a date with my loved one, and then got it here!"

We Hyderabadi\u2019s are kinda bored with rooftops now and so this can be interesting if you wanna get some fresh air while you socialise. On a rainy day, ofcourse, as you would expect, the roof is on. The place is perfect and easily accessible. The ambience is decent enough. The food is good if you enjoy spicy stuff. Prices are not very high. There are quite nice music bands during the weekend. The best part is, the singers here sing in most south indian languages like telugu, Tamil, Malayalam. The place is mostly crowded. Specially during the weekends, you can\u2019t find a table without prior reservations. What I dint like, is the long waiting times for the order to arrive.

Food is just bad..this is my worst experience about food in any cafe..I couldn't understand why people are recommending this cafe..and it's a veg cafe\ud83d\ude33...I should give minus rating to them but there is no option at all..\nWe ordered:\n\u2713Cheese chilli toast (0/5)\n\u2713Paneer tikka sandwich (0/5)\n\u2713Coffee mocha (1/5)\n\u2713Cappuccino (1/5)\n\u2713 Tripple chocolate cake (0/5)\nI won't recommend to waste your money on their food..plating is also bad\n\n2. Service is too poor..they are not cleaning tables at all..they don't have pepper powder to sprinkle also..they are just bad..they have given automatic token dispenser to customer but it was ringing after the food we have took from them..so so bad experience..\n\n3.we didn't't like the ambience also..if u want to sit outside that is also a bad decision..so don't go.. Highly not recommend \ud83d\udc4e\ud83d\udc80"

Another good thing is that the cafe is open 24*7, so you can visit the place any time. The quantity of the coffee provided is more than enough. Personally, i am never able to finish even the regular coffee. The snacks provided are good for short bites.  Have been to this  place several times and  will surely recommend it. The ambience  of the place is strongly built on bike and car theme. You can even hire expensive cars & bikes from this place. Must visit for quick bites."

It screams like one and does well.\n\nI had the coffee and it was good, and served hot.. unlike those yippie joints where it\u2019s lukewarm. The way it should be. Staff is warm and friendly.\n\nThere are plenty of bakery options to choose from, both vegetarian and non-vegetarian. The prices are also fairly reasonable.\n\nParking is tricky as you may need to park in basement. I was lucky to get slot outside.\n\nMust visit if you like bikes, fast cars. A few cycles are kept on display too but I am a cyclist myself and they were ok sort.\n\nIt certainly is a unique experience and must visit spot."

One coffee had a hair strand and we had to ask them a lot to change it.\nStaff is non cooperative.\n\nEven the vibe was not upto the status.\n\nI would suggest Driven Cafe to maintain and work on the food and ambience quality and hygiene."

The mozzarella carrozza was really good.. the pomodoro sauce is delicious with it. The sonic cold brew was not so good. The espresso is way too strong and the citrus flavour is mentioned sweet in the menu.. but it isn't really sweet.. I was disappointed."

You will find a variety of options in the menu to try out.\n\nWhat I really liked is the coffee menu. Damn so cool is what I would say. We tried berry's coffee tail (which is their signature cold coffee) and Yung Yang (a Hong kong special coffee which is a blend of tea, coffee over condensed milk). Very different from all the fancy coffee cafes in Hyderabad. This was a surprise for me!\n\nComing to food, its okay I wouldn't say something great but good overall. Its a place good for kids and family for a lazy dinner or lunch. Ambience is good too. Easy going and nothing fancy here. Just a simple but efficient sitting area (bright in the day and shiny at night).\n\nLacks good dessert options. I must say good for health conscious diners\ud83d\ude00\n\nService is quick and friendly. Enough space to park the car. So wouldn't be an issue. Overall a good place to dine or go out for a coffee at Jubilee Hills."

I recently visited and tried their new offering, the mozzarella carrozza, along with a classic veg pasta with Alfredo sauce.\n\nThe mozzarella carrozza was a decent addition to their menu, providing a tangy flavor that was enjoyable.\nHowever, it didn't quite blow me away. On the other hand, their veg pasta with Alfredo sauce was a standout. The pasta was cooked to perfection, the sauce was creamy and flavorful, and the overall taste was exceptional.

Taste - This is the key part of the review. I had 5 dishes here and they were great!\na. Cheese balls - They serve you with 10 pieces of crispy mozzarella cheese balls. They are bigger than normal ones. Quantity is neither less nor more. Its 9/10 and I have taken 1 point for them using a ketchup instead of fresh tomato pur\u00e9e. I suggest them to try Jalape\u00f1o based sauce.\nb. Crispy corn - Best tasting crispy corn I had till date. No complaints about excess oil or the corn kernels or the taste. Taste infact was MIND BLOWING.\nc. Paneer Tikka Pakeezah - Best tasting paneer tikka of my life. I didn\u2019t know paneer tikka could be this good.\nd. Farm fresh Pizza - This was a bad one. I am not a fan of thin crust and hence asked for extra cheese but it was not enough. Then the base sauce of this pizza was chilli sauce and that\u2019s disappointing from this kind of cafe.\ne. Pink sauce pasta - This was amazing as well. Will give it only 9/10 because of the horrible garlic bread. It was just toasted bread with no butter or garlic. Difficult to chew.\nf. Soda - They inherently dont use ice cubes and that\u2019s something good.\n\n2. Ambiance - Not bad. Definitely better in the night.\n\n3. Pricing - It costed about 2600 for what I ate. I find fair considering that it was very heavy for 3 people\n\nI visited here 1 more time after almost a year and man it still impressed me! My core non vegetarian friends were also super happy with the place and they are doing a good job!!"

On a recent Saturday evening, I dropped by for a friend's birthday and was taken aback by the serene setting amidst the weekend hustle\u2014surprisingly, the cafe was not packed.\n\nA testament to thoughtful design, the ambiance exudes vibrancy. Drawing inspiration from nature, bamboo ceilings, trees lining the space, and pebble flooring coalesce into a harmonious aesthetic. The omnipresent greenery injects life into every nook, and with a sprawling seating layout, including an inviting open area and patio seating, one isn't short of choices.\n\nService was top-notch. The attentive, friendly, and efficient staff had us seated promptly and were accommodating to our every request, setting the tone for the culinary journey ahead.\n\nWith a large group, we sampled a diverse range: from the spicy zing of Chilli Paneer and the smoky goodness of Paneer Tikka to the crunch of lotus stem starters and water chestnuts. The Exotic Veg Pizza and Alfredo Pasta satiated our western cravings, while the Veg Fried Rice, Veg Manchuria, and Veg Noodles paid homage to Asian flavors. The Malai Broccoli was a succulent surprise, with Thai Curry warming our palates. A hot brownie rounded off the evening. Mocktails quenched our thirst with their invigorating mixes. Freshness resonated in every bite, echoing the use of handpicked ingredients.\n\nAll in all, Makobrew World Coffee Bar boasts generous portions and tick marks on all restaurant essentials. A must-visit for those seeking a blend of ambiance, service, and culinary delight."

We were first told they don't accept online reservations, which was frustrating. Then, they insisted that they only allow couples, and when we asked to see this policy on their website, they quickly backpedaled and allowed us in. This inconsistency left a bad taste even before we sat down.\nThe ambience was an absolute letdown - far below what we expected. The live band was another disappointment. I had heard a lot about great live music scene at this place, but the reality was otherwise.\nThe only saving grace for this place is its food and courteous servers, but it was far from enough to salvage the entire experience. With such an experience, there's no chance I would recommend this place to anyone."

Prior reservation is necessary at least on weekends. There are very limited sitting tables. However there are a number of standing tables to enjoy the live music. There is very limited out door seating available too. There is not much to grab the attention inside when it comes to ambience. Overall an ok-ish ambience and not worth the prices but the vibe is good because of the music.\n\nFood and drinks: the menu is quite usual and has a mix of Indian, Asian, and few italian dishes. looks like they have certain food items that go fast with the crowd.. rest of them are not available or served with minor changes. This was a little disappointing. However the taste is good. Certainly will make you go back to the plate after a bite. Crispy corn and pasta is a must try. Heads up ...There is no plain water. Only alkaline water ( a way to charge more. LoL) drinks are pricey for what this place is offering either wrt the ambience or the quantity.\n\nService: we had a few hiccups with the staff. They wouldn't allow people inside with casual footwear and dand for shoes even though there is no wooden floor inside which makes no sense at all. The food service is quick and the food serving staff are very friendly."

Ambience was very good. Neat and clean. Separate rest rooms available for gents and ladies. But only one. Parking is inadequate.at the max 3 cars can be parked. Similarly less food options for Sunday lunch. Only meals and variety rice. Even chappathi or parotta were not available. Mgmt can try to have other options at least during friday saturday and sunday. The captain who took the order the restaurant is open from 6 am to 11 pm. It's good."

While there were some positive aspects, there were also areas that fell short of expectations.\n\nStarting with the positives, the ambiance of the restaurant is quite pleasing. The decor is stylish, and the atmosphere is inviting, making it a good spot for a casual dinner or a date night. Additionally, the attendants were well-behaved and polite, providing good service throughout our meal.\n\nHowever, there were a few significant drawbacks that detracted from the overall experience. Firstly, the space is not well-suited for larger groups. We were a party of ten, and the seating arrangement was quite cramped and uncomfortable. It's clear that the restaurant is better suited for smaller groups.\n\nRegarding the food, I found it to be average at best, especially considering the price point. Some dishes, in particular, did not live up to the standard one would expect from a restaurant of this caliber.\n\nIn summary, while Parampara has a pleasant ambiance and courteous staff, the food quality and seating arrangements for larger groups leave much to be desired. If you're planning a visit, it might be best to go with a smaller group and manage your expectations regarding the food."

We were charged a whooping \u20b9650 per person, and yet the service was absolutely subpar.\n\n1. No Communication, No Transparency\n\u2013 Nowhere was it mentioned that rotis, naan, or chapatis were available as part of the buffet. No staff informed us, no signage, nothing!\n\u2013 When we inquired about it while paying the bill, we were shocked to hear that they expect customers to ask! Since when do diners have to guess what\u2019s included in a buffet?\n\n2. Horrible Service and Indifference\n\u2013 The staff showed zero effort in guiding or assisting guests.\n\u2013 Instead of making the dining experience smooth, they seemed careless and unwilling to engage with customers.\n\n3. Overpriced for the Experience Provided\n\u2013 If you\u2019re charging \u20b9650 per person, at least ensure basic service and transparency.\n\u2013 Not informing about core food items feels like a scam\u2014they hope you don\u2019t ask, so they can save on costs.\n\n4. Final Verdict\n\u2013 If you value good service and honesty in dining, avoid this place.\n\u2013 The management needs to seriously rethink their customer experience instead of trying to make money through deception.\n\nWould I go back? Absolutely NOT."

Each drink has 30ml of alcohol and the food portion is half of regular portions. For the price, it's a great deal. We ordered almost 15 dishes and everything tasted really good. The cocktails were nice too. The service was alright. It might be slow if it's a busy night.\nThe place has a huge courtyard and two floors with open air seating. There is a small enclosed AC area on the group floor. The only issue we had was mosquitoes.\nI would recommend Happy Hours as on other days, the prices are way high."

The food was served pretty cold.\n\nThe starters, maggi cheese balls were below average and served cold, veg manchuria was hot but the there was no proper binding and it was breaking when we tried to eat it.\n\nThe only best thing was the Alfredo pasta it was hot, creamy and spicy with the garlic bread. When  lasagna was ordered, I was thinking it would be with lasagna sheets, but it turned out to be something else. It was over creamy and the sticks were very oily too.\n\nOverall it was a disappointing experience being here after hearing a lot positive reviews."

This place has it all, from polite and humble staff to lip smacking food.\nWas here on a weekday evening, and this place had good crowd.\nThe Mudbrick kitchen and bar is divided into four sections. One is right next to the Pheonix and the band stage, next to it is the live earth oven kitchen where pizzas are made. The second section is enclosed with 5-6 tables inside and beautiful Graffiti on the wall with some dream catchers.\nThere are two roof top sections, one on the left is dedicated to romantic candle light dinners and one on the right has huge lounging space.\nThe area is well knit for all kind of occasions.\nComing to food and drinks, started with a couple of mocktails and cocktails.\nI don't wanna be specific with the name of the drinks because everything on the menu is superb. You can order and try it for yourself.\nBut among the cocktails, i personally love the Pinacolada and chilli guava.\nStarted with some prawns Tom Yum soup, it was decent, could have been a little better.\nMudbrick usually have soup of the day options, which changes every other day.\nThe highly recommended starters here are the Burmese parcel and Bharwan Kumbh. These two are the most delishhhh and should definitely be tried.\nAlso tried peri peri prawns, jalapeno poppers, thai basil chilly paneer. One more a must try starter is Afghani Murg tikka, the blend of spices and the smoky flavour to the kebab, is just scrumptious.\nTangdi kebabs are also decent.\nLamb chops are also served here. The spices and marination part of the chops were perfect except for the meat, was a little chewy, could have been cooked more.\nAOP chicken is one of the speciality here, highly recommended.\nAlso tried the mexican brickwood oven pizza. For the Main course had the chicken tikka biryani. To my surprise it was one of the best Biryanis I have had.\nTotally recommend it when you visit here.\nIn desserts had the chocolate brownie with vanilla icecream.\nOverall the food and service of this place is on point \ud83d\udcaf\nThe ambience and vibe gives you a good time here.\nHighly recommended.\nHappy eating \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a"

Rupesh Rana was performing when I had visited this place for a weekend dinner, and me and my friends had a nice time.\n\nThe exterior is dimly lit, creating a cosy ambiance. The private dining is where we sat, it is decorated with Mandala art on the back wall and bright warm lighting. I liked the minimalist style of the interiors.\n\nWe started off with some of their appetizing soups; Roasted Tomato & Bell Pepper Cappuccino, Ala Funghi Tea Set and Chicken Thai Tom Yum Soup. All of these were, but I specially liked the Ala Funghi Tea set. It was quite unique and tasted great.\n\nNext from the starters, we had Smoked Chicken Bruschetta, which was quite good, Patthar ka Gosht was absolutely perfect and delicious, Kalmi Kebab and Mutton Galouti Kebab were fine and Peri Peri Prawns which seemed slightly undercooked.\n\nThen we had the non-veg Platter, which had a variety of grilled items including Patthar ka Gosht and other various kebabs and fish as well. They were all very good. We also had Tarquito, fried tortilla cones filled with beans, jalapeno, tomato salsa and avocado ice cream, which was one of their special dishes. It was very refreshing.\n\nBefore moving onto the main course, we had a few mocktails namely, Mangorita, Safe Sex on the Beach, Virgin Mojito and Fall Alert. Mangorita was very mangoey, Safe sex was cranberry and grape fruit juices and it was very fresh. Rest were fine.\n\nFrom the main course we ordered Chicken Tikka Pizza, Chicken Alfredo Pasta in white sauce and Chicken Spaghetti in mix sauce. Pizza wasn't that great. The toppings were fine but the base wasn't satisfactory. Both the pastas though were really good, they made up for the pizza in the entree.\n\nLastly in desserts, we had Homemade Churros, Chocolate Dunkers and Creme Brulee. All were good, but Creme Brulee was the best. Just fabulous! It was the perfect dessert."

If you want to have a good meal, we'd probably suggest you skip the starters and directly jump to the main course. They've got a couple of delicious Indian Main course dishes, like Dal Makhni, Rajma, Tasks Dal, along with some rice and breads. Quite liked their Dal Makhni, it was creamy and had a well balance of flavors. Next, there are some absolutely delicious desserts like the Baked Cheesecake and Churros. We totally loved the baked cheesecake. It had a good texture and was just the right amount of sweet. It was served along with melted Strawberry ice cream, and they complimented each other really well.\nThe starters were quite disappointing, being quite bland in flavors. Their mocktails weren't that good either, except for their Virgin Mojito.\nIf you're an alcohol lover, you would want to try this place because it gives Happy Hours from 12pm to 7pm."

They take almost 45 mins to serve food . Very bad experience. The staff is very rude and this is the first restaurant I m giving very bad review. Just go for another place."

It's very spacious and is located at same place as Carpe Diem\n\nThe Mocktials are very good. The virgin mojito was my favorite when it comes to starters cheese garlic bread has generous amount of cheese & herbs.\nMaggi Cheese Balls fried Maggi noodles stuffed with cheese & mixed herbs with relishing flavours and appealing texture.\n\nIn the main course Alfredo pasta was rich & creamy with fresh veggies. Jeera rice and Yellow dal tadka are absolutely tasty. The rice had good amount of jeera.\n\nWhen it comes to dessert Karachi biscuit cheesecake was delicious in taste with strawberry sauce made from one of the famous Karachi bakery biscuits.Chocolate drunkers - A crispy fillo pastry filled with chocolate bar severed with strawberry & Chocolate sauce was yummy"

MudBrick Kitchen and Bar has an open air seating under the black blue sky with the stars twinkling all over the sky, the bright moon light and some good live music making your dinner more beautiful and romantic provided you are with your girlfriend or Wife . The Restaurant can be visited with family also . Just in case it rains the restaurant has made arrangements for some indoor seating as well with bright lights not to dissapoint their guests and you also have an option for a candle light dinner during the weekends ! We bloggers visited the MudBrick Kitchen and Bar for a session and this started of with some drinks such as the Shangria , Virgin Mojito , silver lining and the Meerut ki Jaan ! The drinks made the summer evening better and then the starters kept coming and were spread all over the table ! My favourite and even the non vegetarians loved this starter named burmese parcels . It was Crisp and tasty and makes you crave for more .An item that you have to ask for even before you look at the menu . The other starters that we got our hands on were the lotus steam and the water chest nut . This particular item can be not liked by everyone as it is not regular starters that you find everywhere . It is filled in some tangy sauce and I also got a chance to taste the maggie cheese balls that were droll worthy ! This item was filled with a lot of cheese inside covered with crispy Maggie fried and also the loaded nachos . As we were about to order the main course the chef gave us a surprise with a nitrogen pan . Betel leaves with vanilla icecream inside ! We were all excited when we saw the item and tasted it . We also ordered a Mexican pizza and it was indeed very good. The pizza was topped with mozzarella cheese and some exotic Vegetables. As a Vegetarian I settled for a fried rice for main course with some garlic sauce . The evening became sweeter when we got a chance to taste the chocolate drunkers . Chocolate bars filled with fillo pastry and not to forget the service , it was fantastic . The crew made a lot of effort to make the evening much better by serving us scrumptious dishes !"

Then we ordered Jalapeno balls, there was no Jalapeno. Pretty cold. We ordered crisps and dips platter. Cold pieces of Garlic nan,cold Nachos and some french fries. Dips served in small disposable cups. Hummus, salsa and mayo. Very little quantity. We ordered Pasta in Arabiatta sauce, which was just ok. Nothing great. For the price they charge, food is very ordinary. Service was prompt."
