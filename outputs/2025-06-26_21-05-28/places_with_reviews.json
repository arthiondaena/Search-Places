The place has a stylish, upbeat vibe with a good mix of indoor and rooftop seating\u2014ideal whether you're out with friends or just unwinding after a long day.\n\nWhat made the night special was the live band. They performed a mix of Bollywood retro hits, 90s favorites, and popular new songs, creating the perfect musical backdrop. It wasn\u2019t just entertainment\u2014it added soul to the whole experience.\n\nThe service was smooth and the staff was attentive without being pushy.\n\nPrices are slightly on the higher side, but the live music, lively atmosphere, and overall experience make it worth it.\n\nIf you're in the mood for good music, chill vibes, and a place that feels alive, Airlive should be on your list."

Okay this is one of the rare live music places with no cover charge hence they have a lot of people wanting to come. The crowd is huge. On Saturday night, they remove chairs and you've to stand and eat all the time. You don't get a table despite booking a table on district. Yeah they continue taking bookings from all platforms despite being at 200% capacity utilisation. Around 11:30, the crowd is no less than Dadar station. There is just no space of dance. People are barely standing. But greed has no limit hence they keep getting more and more people in. Average food. But jeera rice was exceptional and the fourth floor tam jham restaurant which is part of the same group.\n\nNot recommended"
