On a rainy day, ofcourse, as you would expect, the roof is on. The place is perfect and easily accessible. The ambience is decent enough. The food is good if you enjoy spicy stuff. Prices are not very high. There are quite nice music bands during the weekend. The best part is, the singers here sing in most south indian languages like telugu, Tamil, Malayalam. The place is mostly crowded. Specially during the weekends, you can\u2019t find a table without prior reservations. What I dint like, is the long waiting times for the order to arrive. The staff and the ordering system is not very organised.",

We Hyderabadi\u2019s are kinda bored with rooftops now and so this can be interesting if you wanna get some fresh air while you socialise. On a rainy day, ofcourse, as you would expect, the roof is on. The place is perfect and easily accessible. The ambience is decent enough. The food is good if you enjoy spicy stuff. Prices are not very high. There are quite nice music bands during the weekend. The best part is, the singers here sing in most south indian languages like telugu, Tamil, Malayalam. The place is mostly crowded. Specially during the weekends, you can\u2019t find a table without prior reservations. What I dint like, is the long waiting times for the order to arrive. The staff and the ordering system is not very organised."
