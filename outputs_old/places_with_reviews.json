The coffee was alright. If you\u2019re into the more snooty, high end coffee it\u2019s probably great. For me a little overdone, but I do like the way they serve it in different glasses. For dessert we tried carrot cake and the burnt cheesecake. The carrot cake was not carrot cake. It was still good though. It\u2019s just not proper carrot cake. The cheesecake was quite different. It actually tasted more like the Mexican sweet flan, but it was good. The service is very slow, but that\u2019s understandable as they are very busy. Overall a nice place to chill."

The taste was not to my satisfaction, but I also got a cappuccino, which was wonderful.

We had breakfast\u2014the omelettes were lovely, and the granola bowl was delicious.nnThe staff was attentive and went out of their way to make us comfortable, which was a big plus. However, it would have been nice if they had a designated smoking section, as that would have made me more likely to return.nnCoffee-wise, the cappuccino was good, but the pour-over was just ordinary.

Tried the Cranberry Coffee - a Roastery invention & a trademark creation, Americano, and Nutella Blend \u2013 all were great, but the Cranberry Coffee really stood out. The food didn\u2019t disappoint either; the Cheese Balls and Potato Cutlet Sandwich were awesome. The whole vibe is super aesthetic, and they\u2019ve got some great coffee beans to choose from. I even snagged a pouch of beans ground to my pour-over preference. Definitely worth a visit!"

                "text": "Con\u00E7u Hyderabad is a great spot if you\u2019re craving desserts and looking for a cozy caf\u00E9 atmosphere, but there are a few areas that could use some improvement.nnAmbience & Vibe: The caf\u00E9 has a lovely and warm aesthetic. The d\u00E9cor is tasteful, and it\u2019s a comfortable place to unwind, whether you\u2019re meeting up with friends or spending some quiet time alone. The outdoor seating is pleasant, especially in the evenings, but the indoor space can feel a bit cramped, especially during peak hours. Finding a spot to sit on weekends can be challenging, and it does get noisy, which takes away from the relaxed vibe.nnDesserts: The desserts are definitely the highlight here. Con\u00E7u has a variety of beautifully crafted pastries, cakes, and tarts, and the quality is consistently good. My personal favorites are the Hazelnut Tart and the Pistachio \u00C9clair, both of which are rich and flavorful. However, while the desserts look gorgeous, I\u2019ve found that some of them can be overly sweet, especially the macarons. A little more balance in the sweetness would make them more enjoyable. Also, the price point feels a bit on the higher side for what you get.nnFood Menu: Their savory offerings are decent but nothing extraordinary. The sandwiches and croissants are fresh, but I feel like the options are limited and the taste is fairly standard compared to other cafes in the city. I had the Avocado Toast once, and while it was good, it wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d go out of my way to order again. For a place that shines with desserts, the savory menu could use a bit more variety and flavor.nnCoffee & Drinks: Con\u00E7u\u2019s coffee is solid, though not exceptional. I\u2019ve had their cappuccino a few times, and while it\u2019s good, it lacks the depth of flavor that you\u2019d expect from a caf\u00E9 known for its drinks. Their iced coffees are refreshing, especially the Iced Caramel Coffee, but again, nothing stood out as particularly memorable. If you're a casual coffee drinker, you'll probably enjoy it, but for coffee aficionados, it might not hit the mark.nnService: The service is where Con\u00E7u could really improve. The staff are friendly, but during busy hours, it can take quite a while for orders to arrive. On a couple of occasions, I found the wait times for both food and drinks to be longer than expected, and there have been times where my order wasn\u2019t quite right. They are polite and fix things quickly, but the consistency could be better.nnConclusion: Overall, Con\u00E7u is a nice caf\u00E9 with some standout desserts and a charming atmosphere, but there are a few areas that need refining, especially when it comes to service and pricing. It\u2019s a good place to visit if you\u2019re in the mood for something sweet, but with the growing caf\u00E9 culture in Hyderabad, there are several other places that might offer a more well-rounded experience. A solid 4 stars from me!"

Ambiance - this place has a good ambiance, 2 floor cafe where 1st floor has sitting arrangements for family and friends. Which has really good vibe. Ground floor has cafe, stores, shopping centre.nn2. Service- this place was crowded, there will be some waiting period to get place, but personally I didn\u2019t like the service, it was way slow and kind of rude. We have asked for a glass of water but the service boy was some rude and directly told it will take time to get water. Which was not at all good behaviour.nn3. Food - Tea was really a good in taste and enough quantity. As compared to price this was ok. One time visit for me. Bun Maska was really good. Bun was really fresh and tasty.nn4.

We had wraps and one of their signature dishes which is not on their menu card. They have a lot of other items which are not mentioned in the menu so pls do enquire about it before ordering. We had asked them to suggest some dishes to us. They also served us their fresh made chocolate donut as a complimentary sweet diah. It was really well made. Overall a good experience."

Over the years they have expanded to two new branches nearby and extended the seating area of this place. If you are visiting this place do try the Reshmi Kebab w Cheese Naan also while ordering mention that you want the kebab wrapped in egg fluff. If you are roll lover try the Sheesh tawook roll and chicken zinger roll on the milkshake side I'd recommend their signature Rose Mango milkshake and Pina colada mention that you'd prefer less ice in milkshake."

The cozy ambiance with soft lighting and comfortable seating made it a perfect spot to unwind. The staff were incredibly welcoming and attentive, adding to the overall pleasant experience.nnThe menu offered a delightful variety of dishes and beverages. I particularly enjoyed their signature coffee blend, which was rich and flavorful. The food was well-prepared and presented beautifully, showcasing both taste and aesthetic appeal.nnWhile the prices were slightly on the higher side, the quality of the food and service justified the cost. One area for improvement could be the waiting time for the orders, as it was a bit longer than expected.nnOverall, my visit to this cafe was a delightful experience, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a cozy place to enjoy good food and drinks in Hyderabad."

These are offered by default as though they are free. I would expect them to offer normal drinking water by default and give me bottled water only when I ask for it. The culture of bottled water, which is a trend post COVID and which most restaurants are now exploiting in the name of hygiene, should go away. Please do your bit to reduce plastic waste."

Firstly water is the first thing that anyone serves in a restaurant and if they were going to charge for it they should have mentioned  it right in the beginning. The waiters always ask if we would like to have bottled water or regular water and then the customer is free to choose. But that was not the case here.

One of the best teas I've had in a long time.n- Bun Maska: Absolutely fantastic. The bun was incredibly soft, and the butter was perfectly balanced!n- Vada Pav: Wonderful. It made me feel like I was in Mumbai or Pune.n- Tarri Poha: A bit disappointing. It lacked flavor, and I had to add extra salt. It didn't quite live up to the taste of Nagpur's Tarri Poha.n- Belgian Chocolate Croissant: It was good, but not as authentic as a European croissant.n- Osmania Biscuits: Excellent. They melt in your mouth seamlessly.n- Tawa Pulao with Raita: Decent enough.nnOverall, Niloufer Cafe offers a delightful experience with a few areas for improvement. It's a great place to enjoy a variety of dishes and beverages, with some items standing out more than others. I highly recommend trying their tea and Osmania biscuits!"

It was crazy good \u2013 soft, warm, and a bit sweet. We started with two, but couldn't resist and ordered a couple more to eat there and a couple to take away.nnWe also tried the Poha, but honestly, it was a bit plain on its own, no salt at all.

The pasta was cooked to perfection, and the garlic-infused oil added a heavenly dimension to the dish.

However, my experience here has been mixed.nnWhile the ambiance is undoubtedly a highlight, I found the seating arrangements to be somewhat uncomfortable, with limited space between tables. This detracted from the overall comfort of the dining experience.nnUnfortunately, my disappointment extended to the menu offerings. Despite visiting the caf\u00E9 bar multiple times over the past few months, I failed to find dishes or drinks that truly appealed to my palate. While taste preferences vary, I found both the food and cocktails to be rather average, lacking the wow factor I had hoped for.nnAdditionally, the pricing at L\u00E9 Vantage Caf\u00E9 Bar leans towards the higher end, which may not be justified by the quality of the offerings. While I wouldn't discourage others from giving it a try, especially for the ambiance alone, I do believe that the establishment could benefit from refining its menu and focusing more on customer service.nnOverall, L\u00E9 Vantage Caf\u00E9 Bar falls short of expectations, with its standout feature being the ambiance. While it may not leave you with a feeling of regret, it also fails to deliver anything truly exceptional. For me, the food and drinks were passable but didn't leave a lasting impression."

The location, accessible easy car parking with valet (though you may not need it unless the parking lot gets full), the luxurious welcome arch and gateway which in particular makes you feel like you're transported to a different world are really good. On entering you will definitely like the variety of seating arrangements, whether be it the open area with shades, a cafe like area and then the more traditional restaurant setup on the first floor. The quality of ambience is top notch and this is really what you should come to experience when here. Come here prepared to spend more than an hour, eat at a leisurely pace, bring a book to read, etc.nnNow let's about the meal experience in itself. We had chicken wings, pita bread with hummus for appetizers followed by pesto cream pasta and tofu broccoli rice Chinese Bowl. The food is more or less 4 stars for their taste, presentation and portions. The food is meant to be enjoyed a bit bland as the taste is subtle. Portions were good for 2. The wait staff were friendly though they seemed a bit understaffed even to support a modest crowd.nnOur meal worked out to 1000INR per person, so you know you really paid for the ambience (which is why you should come here prepared for the experience and not the food by itself). 5 stars since I pretty much expected a very friendly ambience for a date with my loved one, and then got it here!"

The service is prompt but discrete, there is no distracting music and the place is relatively uncrowded so nobody rushes at you with the bill even before you finish. There are limited vegan options, but the entire menu is vegetarian so you have a lot to choose from. They are also good with minor customisations. Both the dishes we ordered were a little on the spicy side, so if you have spice intolerance, do ask them to tone it down a bit- I found it prefect. The beautiful art work on the walls adds to the ambiance without detracting from the meal. Will certainly revisit.nThere is ample parking inside, which is an added bonus. We took the stairs, but there is also a lift. You can also drop in at the Art Gallery on the way in or out- there is always some interesting exhibition going on there."

                "text": "Recently, we visited The Gallery Cafe ,  located in Banjara Hills. First impressions - it's a decent spot , particularly for art lovers who might enjoy the artistic ambience.nnNow, coming to the food, we tried a variety of items: White Sauce Penne Veg Pasta, French Fries, Vietnamese Iced Coffee, Brownie Shake, and the Capricorn Pizza. To be honest, except for the pizza, everything was quite disappointing. The Capricorn Pizza was good, though not exceptional. It had a typical taste that you'd find in many Hyderabad cafes\u2014satisfying but nothing extraordinary.nnThe two most disappointing items were the White Sauce Penne Pasta and the Vietnamese Iced Coffee. The pasta\u2019s sauce was the biggest letdown. The consistency was thin and watery, far from the creamy texture I expected, and the flavor was bland. Additionally, the portion size of the pasta was a bit underwhelming considering the price, which added to the disappointment.nnAs for the Vietnamese Iced Coffee, it was the most disappointing. We ordered it based on the promising description, which mentioned it as \u201Cdelightfully sweet, full-bodied, and almost like a dessert.\u201D However, what we received was far from that\u2014it lacked sweetness and tasted more like plain black coffee with ice cubes, completely missing the dessert-like appeal the menu promised.nnThe French fries were average, but the cheese served alongside lacked flavor and didn\u2019t complement the fries well. The brownie shake was another letdown\u2014it tasted oddly like Cerelac, possibly due to the poor quality of the brownie used, which overpowered the shake\u2019s flavor.nnOverall, the food and drinks need considerable improvement. There's a lot of scope for enhancing the taste and ensuring that menu descriptions align with what\u2019s actually served, especially for the coffee options."

They recommended some toast with fresh avacado and a custard apple shake with zero added sugar.nnI enjoyed every bit of the food. If you happen to visit in December, you must try the shake."

Quite empty on a weekday afternoon but noisy -  really bad music, reminiscent of a club + the competing sound of the few other humans here watching videos on their phones. Food is baseline ok.  I am new to Hyderabad, and this will not be one of the places I return to. AND the lift is unsafe. As we went down, it stopped between floors. A staff member yelled down to us to open the collapsible door and shut it again"

This cafe is located exactly on top of a Art Gallery which was closed on the day we visited and we haven't found many vehicles parked outside. I was very skeptical on the taste and visited with friends. We ordered Shakes and they didn't have the same so was disappointed and wanted to move to some other cafe. But somehow wanted to try something. We ordered Mojito, Cheese Sticks and Penne Alfredo. The taste was so good that we excused them for the shakes and wanted to order more but we were full down then.nnIn conclusion, worth the visit. Don't be disappointed if they are not having a few items from menu. Try out their Pasta for sure."

Loved the smokey sambrani that's used to keep the environment relaxed.nnA pretty cool and small menu that leaves you no confusion to choose. The pricing for two would be around 500-800INR which is decent enough I think.nnWell, it's been quite a while, I had a proper Lasagna (My last and best was at The Pasta Bar Veneto which is closed now) thought I will give it a shot here and ordered #Vegetable #Lasagna. Though the taste was bang on, I would love more parmesan cheese on the top and baked. Missed that little cheesy effect. Moving on and I asked for the best pizza suggestion for which I got, #FunkieVeggieLoverPizza. Cheese and white sauce overloaded pizza that you can not see the toppings and have to call the person asking for toppings \uD83D\uDE1B ... Again the taste and toppings were very good but this time the cheese wasn't gooey \uD83D\uDE1E ..nnI am neither satisfied nor left sad for the fact I have used #zomatogold \uD83D\uDE1B . Overbill I paid was only for the lasagna which is 320 including taxes.nnWell, Will, I go again? Yes for their cheesecake \uD83D\uDE1Bn#annadathasukhibhavann#ClickEatXploreYo Live #CEXY"
