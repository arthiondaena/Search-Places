The service is prompt but discrete, there is no distracting music and the place is relatively uncrowded so nobody rushes at you with the bill even before you finish. There are limited vegan options, but the entire menu is vegetarian so you have a lot to choose from. They are also good with minor customisations. Both the dishes we ordered were a little on the spicy side, so if you have spice intolerance, do ask them to tone it down a bit- I found it prefect. The beautiful art work on the walls adds to the ambiance without detracting from the meal. Will certainly revisit.\nThere is ample parking inside, which is an added bonus. We took the stairs, but there is also a lift. You can also drop in at the Art Gallery on the way in or out- there is always some interesting exhibition going on there.",

First impressions - it's a decent spot , particularly for art lovers who might enjoy the artistic ambience.\n\nNow, coming to the food, we tried a variety of items: White Sauce Penne Veg Pasta, French Fries, Vietnamese Iced Coffee, Brownie Shake, and the Capricorn Pizza. To be honest, except for the pizza, everything was quite disappointing. The Capricorn Pizza was good, though not exceptional. It had a typical taste that you'd find in many Hyderabad cafes\u2014satisfying but nothing extraordinary.\n\nThe two most disappointing items were the White Sauce Penne Pasta and the Vietnamese Iced Coffee. The pasta\u2019s sauce was the biggest letdown. The consistency was thin and watery, far from the creamy texture I expected, and the flavor was bland. Additionally, the portion size of the pasta was a bit underwhelming considering the price, which added to the disappointment.\n\nAs for the Vietnamese Iced Coffee, it was the most disappointing. We ordered it based on the promising description, which mentioned it as \u201cdelightfully sweet, full-bodied, and almost like a dessert.\u201d However, what we received was far from that\u2014it lacked sweetness and tasted more like plain black coffee with ice cubes, completely missing the dessert-like appeal the menu promised.\n\nThe French fries were average, but the cheese served alongside lacked flavor and didn\u2019t complement the fries well. The brownie shake was another letdown\u2014it tasted oddly like Cerelac, possibly due to the poor quality of the brownie used, which overpowered the shake\u2019s flavor.\n\nOverall, the food and drinks need considerable improvement.

Loved the smokey sambrani that's used to keep the environment relaxed.\n\nA pretty cool and small menu that leaves you no confusion to choose. The pricing for two would be around 500-800INR which is decent enough I think.\n\nWell, it's been quite a while, I had a proper Lasagna (My last and best was at The Pasta Bar Veneto which is closed now) thought I will give it a shot here and ordered #Vegetable #Lasagna. Though the taste was bang on, I would love more parmesan cheese on the top and baked. Missed that little cheesy effect. Moving on and I asked for the best pizza suggestion for which I got, #FunkieVeggieLoverPizza. Cheese and white sauce overloaded pizza that you can not see the toppings and have to call the person asking for toppings \ud83d\ude1b ... Again the taste and toppings were very good but this time the cheese wasn't gooey \ud83d\ude1e ..\n\nI am neither satisfied nor left sad for the fact I have used #zomatogold \ud83d\ude1b . Overbill I paid was only for the lasagna which is 320 including taxes.\n\nWell, Will, I go again? Yes for their cheesecake \ud83d\ude1b\n#annadathasukhibhava\n\n#ClickEatXploreYo Live #CEXY",
